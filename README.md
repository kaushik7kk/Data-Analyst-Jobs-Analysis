# Data Analysis Jobs in the United States

This was my first project in the data analysis domain. I was assigned this project as part of my college curriculum and was to be worked on with two of my fellow classmates.
<br><br>
Different categories of the project were based on the actual progression through our subject syllabus. 
<br>
Each candiidate was supposed to be playing equal role in all the processes including:-
 - Data Cleaning
 - Actual Data Analysis
 - Question framing
 - Visualization
<br>
The whole project has to be seen as a learning process and includes amateur approaches as well as copied ones from the internet.
